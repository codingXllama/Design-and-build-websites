<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
<p>Eggs are one of my favorite foods. Here is a recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.</p>
<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbs of cream</li>
    <li>1 tbs of butter</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
<li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
<li>Once the butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
<li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if you are making an omelette)</li>
<li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate until served)</li>
</ol>
